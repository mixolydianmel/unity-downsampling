== What is it?

This is a simple downsampling fullscreen shader for Unity.
It contains only the basic functionality,
and applies universally to the whole screen.

== Controls

The resolution of the downsampling can be controlled via slider
in the Downsampling Material located in Effects > Downsampling.
